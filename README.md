 Nonlinear Data Structure and Algorithms

This implementation aims to understand the structure and main concepts of trees, an abstract type of data.

The first three functions obtains the Tree Transversals, which are this:
* Pre-order  (R,E,D)
* In-order   (E,R,D)
* Post-order (E,D,R)

In addition, we will search, through binary search, a character (typed by the user) in the created tree.

We will also calculate, using properties, the fundamental characteristics of the tree, which are:
* NODES
* HEIGHT
* LEAF
